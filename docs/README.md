# What is OpenAgua?

OpenAgua is a web-based application for modeling water systems for water resources planning and management. It aims to help develop insights to complex water issues in a collaborative online space. To achieve this, it offers a powerful set of basic tools for most use cases, as well as an increasing number of advanced tools for more complex modeling and computing cases. While OpenAgua is oriented toward water systems, it can also be easily adapted for other kinds of systems, such as energy systems.

OpenAgua is built by [a dedicated team](learn-more/the-team.md) of developers, water experts, and funders.

## Key Innovations

OpenAgua includes a range of key innovations over existing desktop-based software applications:

* **Integrated collaboration and sharing** - The modern web facilitates technical collaboration and sharing for transparency and data discovery, central motivations of OpenAgua; collaboration and sharing features are deeply integrated into OpenAgua, though much additional work remains. [Read more](how-to-use/user-guide/collaboration.md).
* **Cloud-based computing** - Although desktop computers are continually increasing speed, on-demand access to even more powerful and numerous cloud computers significantly increases our ability to discover water management solutions in an increasingly deeply uncertain world. OpenAgua allows users to use any internet-connected computer to take on tough computing tasks, from commercial cloud computers to personal laptops.

* **Open source \(mostly\)** - As much of OpenAgua as possible is open source. In particular, the default water allocation model is completely open source \([see it here](https://github.com/openagua/waterlp)\). The core OpenAgua API is not yet open source, but will be.

## Availability

For now, OpenAgua is only available online at [www.openagua.org](https://www.openagua.org), though we are working to create a self-hosting option.

## Main Features

### Water system modelling

Water system modeling needs is built into the DNA of OpenAgua, even though OpenAgua is also flexible enough to accommodate any arbitrary model. OpenAgua by default includes a demand-driven, priority-based simulation model, similar in concept to WEAP. [Read more](https://openagua.github.io/waterlp).

**Advanced scenario builder**

In order to adequately asses several decision frameworks, aside from the baseline scenario, OpenAgua has the feature of constructing scenarios. The user will be able to incorporate a mix of potential uncertainties and make projections in a specified time frame. By implementing scenarios, the user’s project will developed a more robust and deep analysis. Evaluation, identification and establishment of the best strategies into potential plans will ensure the user to select the best future projection for water planning.

Learn more in the [user guide](./how-to-use/user-guide/setup-model/view-edit-scenarios.md).

**Standardized data organization**

All data of OpenAgua is organized using the [Hydra Platform](http://www.hydraplatform.org) software, which ensures consistent and quality-controlled data organization. The use of Hydra Platform also ensures cross-compatibility between OpenAgua and other Hydra-compliant software systems, such as the Hydra-native web application [https://hydra.org.uk](https://hydra.org.uk)

**Advanced analytical tools**

OpenAgua integrates modern visualization tools, based on the popular [Plotly library](https://plot.ly/javascript/). Since no single platform can meet all user needs, users can also either download data for offline analysis or connect directly to their data from other data analysis platforms, such as R or Jupyter Notebook.

**Collaborative modeling and scenario analysis**

OpenAgua is designed from the ground up for collaboration and sharing. Practical examples of collaboration include:
* Technical collaboration between modelers.

Despite these options, OpenAgua by means requires transparency; access to data is controlled, and private data is secure.

**Flexible computing**

Flexible computing is another core feature of OpenAgua. As noted above, OpenAgua ships with a default model that can be run without any configuration on the part of the user. However, models can also be configured to use a range of different computing modes, with the only requirement being that the computer is connected to the internet. Read more about [model engine configuration](./how-to-use/user-guide/configuration/model-engines.md).

**Security**

Standard website data security best practices ensure that your data is protected. OpenAgua has employed a tiered ownership system. The user is able to have restrictions and control who has access to your networks and projects as well as the level of permission they have

**Open Source**

The OpenAgua software is open source and mostly free \(some optional functions require a license\). Open Source software lie on the practice of granting wide range of rights to users. OpenAgua is determined to engage innovation and development throughout the contributions of water management social figures. Benefits on letting actors of knowledge and learning, to compute processes and products, are sources of innovation on the water field.

The fact that users’ needs and approaches to target problems are in constant change, open source softwares enables the opportunity to evolve by the constant developing of prototype code innovations. For instance, the user’s community of OpenAgua can freely make improvements and innovate codes on the platform or in their networks. The source code of OpenAgua is written in Python and it can be checked out on GitHub.

While the main functionality of OpenAgua is free, some additional useful features require a license to use. These features are disabled by default, but can be enabled, and are available in the paid version of OpenAgua.org.
