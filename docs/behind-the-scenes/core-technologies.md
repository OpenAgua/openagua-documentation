# Core Technologies

Core technologies used to configure OpenAgua are a mix of open source libraries. This will enable the platform to be in constant improvement and evolution. We thank the thousands of developers out there for all of these!

## Data Management

To start and as mention above, data management in OpenAgua is built on [Hydra Platform](http://hydraplatform.org) a network-based data management platform.

## Web stack \(front-end and back-end\)

Like any interactive, data-driven web-based application, OpenAgua uses a mix of front-end \(client\) and back-end \(server\) technologies, with data processing occuring both client-side and server-side.

The back-end is built with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), a "microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions". This means that server-side website actions are written in Python, enabling easy development. Server-side work includes serving individual webpages and interactions with Hydra Platform, among other various functions. Numerous Python packages are used for server-side data processing.
