# User Guide

The purpose of this user guide is to help get started modeling right away; describe key concepts that underpin the data organization and modeling principles used by OpenAgua, and describe how to use specific application features.

For now, this documentation is organized around the main user areas of the website, focusing on technical aspects (technologies involved, methods used, etc.), but also use in some cases. General help for the registered user is found on the site itself, under "Help".

This guide is primarily targeted toward the application user who does not want to customize the underlying code. For users who would like to better understand the more technical aspects of OpenAgua itself, see the [Development section](./learn-more/development/README.md)
