# View/edit data

Two tools are provided for entering data. First, the **Basic Data Input** allows input of data on a per-scenario, per-resource, per-variable basis. In contrast, the **Input Table Creator** allows input for multiple scenarios/resources/variables at once, using a pivot table-style input mechanism. Both of these are described.

## Basic Data Input

The basic data editor consists of several areas:

1. Scenario selector
2. Resource tree
3. Variable selector
4. Data input
5. Notes & metadata input
6. Misc. supporting functions

### Scenario selector

### Resource tree

### Variable selector

### Data input

### Data preview

## Multi Data editor

The advanced data editor is a powerful tool to input data, it is based on using a pivot table to arrange all data and information. By using pivot tables, this editor gives the user flexibility and analytical skills resulting on well-organized source data.

To start using the advanced data editor first identify the filters bar and select the feature, variable and scenario. In here the user is able to select more than one data to edit. Click Load to boot your pivot table. Start dragging features to the row and column bank. Notice there is a drop down menu of aggregators, by using this, data is set to be original, average or a sum. Arrange your table as you prefer and start filling it either manually or by copy-paste from another data sheet. There is an extra button called Block, this allows to add columns to every feature of the table which might be useful for adding more data to specific variables. The user is able to make as many pivot tables as it like, just save your set up and open it at any time.

The key limitation of this pivot table is it may become unstable or unusable after 100,000 rows of data. If you reach the limit you will be warned to use the filter at the top to help reduce the amount of data retrieved from the server. This filter enables you to select more specific data based on an arrange of filter criteria including feature type and variable.
