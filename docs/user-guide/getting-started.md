# Getting started

## Orientation

All the projects and networks are stored in the library called **Home**. In here, the user will be able to create new networks and arrange them by the user's preferences. Networks can be shared, edited, exported, deleted and cleaned.

## Modeling process overview


## Quick start

Once you are logged-in, click "add network" in order to start building your project. A window will pop up so you can name and describe your project. Each network can have different versions where you will be able to switch within without loosing any data, we recommend selecting the latest version and looking at the "version history" link before modifying the template. This feature will function in later versions of OpenAgua.

Once your network is set you can start building it by clicking OVERVIEW, also a drop-down menu is shown at the upper right where sharing and editing functions are available.
