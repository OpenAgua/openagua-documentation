##Elements of the schematic model 

While setting the area or the schematic model, 

### Nodes and Links

**Demand Site**
A specific location where users require water to enter a delivery or distribution system for whitdrawal service. Demand sites include: Industrial facilities, irrigation or agriculture districs, municipal sectors, ecological flow requirements, hydropower plants etc.

**Supply Resources**
Resources that provide water supply for demand sites. A supply system is formed by diverse water bodies like catchments, rivers, aquifers and reservoirs connected by conveyances, delivery links and return flows.

**Catchments**
Defined area or basin where surface water from precipitation, melting snow and ice accumulation gets collected by natural landscape into another water body.

**Reservoirs**
An open storage area where water is collected by a catchment or by the artificial transfer of water. These are linked 

**Miscellaneous sources**
Any other sources that provide water to demand sites it can be unconnected rivers, artificial recharge aquifers, pools etc.

**Rivers and Diversions**
Natural flowing watercourse which have a head-flow and an end-flow point. Diversions are nodes that divert water from a river into a canal for example. 

**Flow Requirement**
The minimum amount of water flow in a stream to meet ecological requirements. 

**Conveyance**
Conveyances are delivery links that transport water from a withdrawal node (surface water, miscellaneous water and groundwater) to a demand point

**Delivery Link**
Distribution or transmission links that deliver water from any supply resources to demand sites.

**Return Flow**
Representation of return flows or unused water from demand sites which are delivered to any water body, irrigation crop or a waste water treatment plant for example.
