# Setting up a new model

This describes how to create and set up up a model.
This assumes you have read [Key Concepts](docs.openagua.org/key-concepts) and that you have successfully created an account and logged on.

## Create/edit projects

### Create a project
To create a project, which will contain one or more network, click ‘Add Project’ from the HOME area.

### Edit a project

### Delete a project

## Create/edit networks

### Create network

Once logged-in, click "add network" in order to start building your project. A window will pop up so you can name and describe your project. Each network can have different versions where you will be able to switch within without loosing any data, we recommend selecting the latest version and looking at the "version history" link before modifying the template. This feature will function in later versions of OpenAgua.

### Edit network properties

### Edit network contents

Once your network is created, you can start creating and editing specific features (rivers, dams, etc.) by clicking 'OPEN', which appears over the network's thumbnail.
